## Create a serviceaccount to scan the internal OpenShift registry

The integrations to the internal registry were created automatically. But to enable scanning of images in the internal registry, you'll have to configure valid credentials, so this is what you'll do:

- add a serviceaccount
- assign it the needed privileges
- configure the **Integrations** in ACS with the new credentials

But the first step is to disable the auto-generate mechanism, otherwise your updated credentials would be set back automatically:

- In the **OpenShift Web Console**, switch to the project **stackrox**, go to **Installed Operators->Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes**
- Open your Central instance `stackrox-central-services`
- Switch to the YAML view, under `spec:` add the following YAML snippet (one indent):

```
customize:
    envVars:
      - name: ROX_DISABLE_AUTOGENERATED_REGISTRIES
        value: 'true'
```

- Click **Save**

**Create ServiceAccount to read images from Registry**

- In the **OpenShift Web Console** make sure you are still in the `stackrox` **Project**
- **User Management -> ServiceAccounts -> Create ServiceAccount**
- Replace the example name in the YAML with `acs-registry-reader` and click **Create**
- In the new ServiceAccount, under **Secrets** click one of the `acs-registry-reader-token-...` secrets
- Under **Data** copy the Token
- Using `oc` give the ServiceAccount the right to **read** images from all projects:

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user 'system:image-puller' system:serviceaccount:stackrox:acs-registry-reader -n stackrox
```

**Configure Registry Integrations in ACS**

Access the **ACS Portal** and configure the already existing integrations of type **Generic Docker Registry**. Go to **Platform Configuration -> Integrations -> Generic Docker Registry**. You should see a number of autogenerated (from existing pull-secrets) entries.

You have to change four entries pointing to the internal registry, you can easily recognize them by the placeholder **Username** `serviceaccount`.

For each of the four local registry integrations click **Edit integration** using the three dots at the right:

- Put in `acs-registry-reader` as **Username**
- Paste the token you copied from the secret into the **Password** field
- Select Disable TLS certificate validation
- Press the **Test** button to validate the connection and press **Save** when the test is successful.

**ACS is now able to scan images in the internal registry!**
