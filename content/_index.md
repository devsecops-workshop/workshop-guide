## What is it about
This workshop will introduce you to the application development cycle leveraging [OpenShift's](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) tooling & features with a special focus on securing your environment using [Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (ACS)](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/advanced-cluster-security-kubernetes).
